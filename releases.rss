      <description>Here's a little patch to clean up some issues that sprang up (broken deconstruction speeds, broken work detail scrollbar.) I've also tried to adjust the new material-based dwarf dig speeds to be faster overall - there had to be give somewhere, so legendary miners now aren't as relatively speedy (they are still twice as fast as a novice.) Native metals were also taking way too long to mine. And the lack of drinks effect was coming on a little too strong too early in mining in a noticeable way. General updates (*) Reduced erroneously long deconstruction speeds. (*) Fixed broken scrollbar for work detail labor list. (*) Changed relationship between mining speed, mining skill, and materials. (*) Fixed broken mining speeds for native metals. (*) Moderated lack of drink effect on work speed.</description>
