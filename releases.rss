      <description>Release Notes for 52.02: Fixed hang on Linux when updating an installed mod the first time. Removed the temporary geology variables placement layer/freq/parent from lua to prevent crashes. Fixed crash when opening the mod menu after deleting the %appdata% folder. Fixed a logic issue where any duplicated raws detected will cause further types of duplicated raws to no longer print. Init files are loaded from the game folder first so that updates always apply properly. The game now checks for prefs/arena.txt and prefs/colors.txt. Added more cases of auto-toggling portable mode if something fails to save. </description>
